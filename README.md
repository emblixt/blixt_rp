# blixt_rp
Python library developed for analysing wells, doing basic rock physics and AVO modelling.
Several Jupyter notebooks are included to demonstrate the functionality, I suggest to start with "Introduction to blixt_rp.ipynb". A folder of demo/test data 
is also included.

With pip:

> pip3 install git+https://github.com/emblixt/blixt_rp.git

or for the (recommended) development version

> pip3 install git+https://github.com/emblixt/blixt_rp.git@dev
